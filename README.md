Minecraft mod I made as a joke.

***For some reason, the item textures in the inventory don't show up correctly when playing on an Nvidia GPU, it worked fine when testing on Intel HD Graphics 3000. Due to other issues the crafting guide is currently unavailable. Use Just Enough Items to see them in-game. Please let me know if you experience this bug too.***
