Minecraft mod I made as a joke.<br>
The images at the bottom are broken. Ignore it. This stupid guide already caused me much unfortune. <br>
To create a nie block, you'll need quite a bit of wool. <br>
Start off by making the combiner, you'll need it to craft other things later. It can be crafted from any color of wool. <br>

Next, make the backround. Only white wool is accepted. As of today it emits light, but that might be changed because the nie block by itself doesn't.<br>

  - 1 block of wool <br>
<br>
The next step is to craft the letters like so <br>

Now you can obtain the nie block by combining the background and the nie. <br>

If you wish to make your nie block glow like the background, add a torch. <br>
